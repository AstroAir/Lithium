```
Learning requires not mere imagination,
Nor can it be attained through mediocre dedication.
It is through diligent accumulation,
That we shall grow in our education.

Our efforts may falter and fail,
But we must not surrender and bail.
We shall not halt our stride for fear of stumbling,
For setbacks are the price of pursuing enlightenment.

On this quest for truth, we shall encounter obstacles and doubts,
Yet we shall keep our resolve to seek understanding throughout.
Let us nurture a heart that yearns for wisdom and grace,
And never lose sight of this noble race.
